# Automation-on-deploying-Website-over-Containers
In this project I have deployed website of respective languages by interpreter ( here I have used php ) which will automatically check it with the help of file's extension whenever there is a change in GITHUB which will trigger the created job in automation tool JENKINS which will then deploy the file to the respected Apache webserver over the DOCKER container and it will automatically check it its working or not keeping any eye every minutes and it there is any issue it will restart the container by itself and if there's error in file it will inform by mailing the administrator .
